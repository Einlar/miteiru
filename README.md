It has modular main language dictionary and tokenizer (morphological analyzer), heavily based on External software <a href="https://taku910.github.io/mecab/">MeCab</a>, and optinally needs <a href="https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified">JMDict</a> to give language info box. This software is heavily inspired by <a href="https://ookii-tsuki.github.io/Anisubber/">Anisubber</a>. </td>

- You can start by dragging:
  - Any videos (Anime is good) you can get subtitle at https://kitsunekko.net/
  - Any youtube URL
    - Or you can just literally paste any youtube watch video into the miteiru (just ctrl + v into the player)
    - But youtube japanese will only show for videos that have japanese CC or auto-generated japanese CC.
    - Try this:
      - https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=onomappu

## For Casual Users: Installation Guide

- Checkout releases here: https://github.com/hockyy/miteiru/releases

### Mac

- Download the .pkg file
- Because I'm too poor to afford the so called 99 USD apple developer program annual fee, you will encounter the unidentified developer warning.
  - No worry, all codes are open source and I have no intend to harm your Mac... You can even build your own app by following the developer guide below
- Run it this way: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac
- ![image](https://github.com/hockyy/miteiru/assets/19528709/a440a119-49cf-45f1-8c42-93289d20e01e)

### Windows

- Being such a good guy I am, I've provided both the portable one and the setup one, you can just pick any, install it.
- There's this issue where some PC would recognize the setup as a virus... but you can try your own virus total test.

### Ubuntu

- I made the .deb and .AppImage, currently no other build is provided because I'm too lazy

## For Developer: (Own Build) Installation Guide

You can run the followings on the cloned repository: (don't forget to download the LFS files as well)

```bash
npm install
npm run script:initrepo
npm run dev # This to run dev
npm run build # This to build
```

## Mecab and Custom Dictionary Setup (Optional)

Mecab can be downloaded through [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running:

```bash
brew install mecab
```

or in Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install mecab
```

Then, you can run

```bash
which mecab
```

or in Windows, you can directly download the binary file from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mecab/)

to show your default mecab binary file. Use it as the path when asked in Miteiru. Then, you can get JMDict Dictionary in [https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified/releases](https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified/releases). Use it as the path when asked in Miteiru as well. Miteiru will build a LevelDB cache locally. Then, you can enjoy the app!

## MeCab Dictionary Customization

By default, you are using whatever your default Mecab Dictionary offers you, but you can further customize this by modifying the `mecabrc` file which is located in `/opt/homebrew/etc/mecabrc` in MacOS, `C:\Program Files (x86)\MeCab\etc\mecabrc` in Windows, and `/etc/mecabrc` in Ubuntu. For other OS's you gotta figure it our for yourself right now. Shunou, Miteiru's microlibrary can support Unidic, Jumandic, Ipadic, and it's variations. Specifically, if you check out the `dicrc` file of each dictionary, Shunou can support the output format `chamame`, `chasen`, and the classic Jumandic god knows what output format. You can get [UniDic files here](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/unidic/en/)

Configuration file in mac:
```
;
; Configuration file of MeCab
;
; $Id: mecabrc.in,v 1.3 2006/05/29 15:36:08 taku-ku Exp $;
;
; dicdir =  /opt/homebrew/lib/mecab/dic/ipadic
; dicdir =  /opt/homebrew/lib/mecab/dic/jumandic
dicdir =  /opt/homebrew/lib/mecab/dic/unidic
; userdic = /home/foo/bar/user.dic

; output-format-type = wakati
; input-buffer-size = 8192

; node-format = %m\n
; bos-format = %S\n
; eos-format = EOS\n
```

Windows:
```
